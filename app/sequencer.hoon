::  sequencer [UQ| DAO]
::
::  Agent for managing a single UQ| town. Publishes diffs to rollup.hoon
::  Accepts transactions and batches them periodically as moves to town.
::
::  sequencer.hoon is designed to run with a sidecar:
::  https://github.com/uqbar-dao/poa-rollup
::
::  the flow works as such:
::  :sequencer &sidecar-action [%trigger-batch deposits=~]
::  (sequencer produces batch, posts at /pending-batch scry path)
::  :sequencer &sidecar-action [%batch-posted town-root=0x0 block-at=0]
::
::  to use this agent locally, for testing, one can use the -zig!batch
::  thread included in this repo, which will automatically fetch a recent
::  ETH block height, but spoof the town-root.
